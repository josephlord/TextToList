TextToList
==========

Basic multiline list parsing in Swift - incomplete and intended for my use not polished for release.

This is intended to parse multiline text input into a list for my Fast Lists application. Text format expected is similar to markdown lists (but not the same as all text is interpretted as lists - see the tests for an example.).

The code isn't efficient or that beautiful as I am focussing on trying to use functional style, immutable values and recursion as an exercise.

In terms of license at this point I think it is something along the lines of the WTF license with a bit of "are you really sure you want to use it" thrown in too. This may change for future more capable versions but will not remove any rights granted to this version of the code.
